### Hi everyone! I'm Felipe üëç

I am a cybersecurity student, with interest in several areas, including Cybersecurity, DevSecOps, programming and studying the area of social engineering combined with Ethical Hacking.
Driven by challenging problems, I seek to improve my knowledge through CTFs such as HackTheBox and TryHackMe in conjunction with bootcamps and certifications that I intend to complete in the area of Cybersecurity to evolve and improve myself more and more as a professional.
